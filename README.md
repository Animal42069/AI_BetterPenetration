# AI_BetterPenetration

This mod is an attempt to make the penetration that occurs in AI look a little bit better.  I started with Roy12's PVCollider, but I ended up making so many changes that I felt it was better to create a separate repository for it rather than try to pull it in to his.  

# Features

Maintains the length of the penis at all times, including penetraion.  This is accomplised by finding an appropriate spot within the girl and placing the penis tip at that spot.<br />
This is done for vaginal, anal, and oral penetraion.<br />
Maintain proper rotation of the penis, no more spinning shafts during certain positions.<br />
Adjust the length of the penis, make it as short or long as you want.<br />
Can add softness to the penis.  A soft penis will squish/shorten after penetration (similar to unmodded behavior, but not to the same extent) <br />

# Notes

Male uncensor requires a shaft bone and a head bone.<br />
No special female uncensors are needed, but if you use Roy12's vagina uncensor it will utilize the dynamic bones if they are present.<br />
Options to adjust properties of the dynamic bones.<br />
The mod works by keeping track of certain bones on the girl and using that information to set boundaries.  Any character made in the game will have these bones.  If somehow these bones aren't present then it will revert to default behavior.
The mod tries to place the head inside the girl at a position that pierces the original target (vagina, anus, mouth).  Due to sizes, lengths, angles and different positions this isn't always possible.  It is recommended to use Mantas' BetterHScenes to adjust the characters in the scene to make the geometry involved more favorable
